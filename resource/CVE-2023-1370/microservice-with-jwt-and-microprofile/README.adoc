# Microprofile JWT Movie Chat

This web application shows how to use Microprofile JWT to secure your microservices.
It uses Apache TomEE as the default Microprofile implementation.

# OAuth2 + JWT (STS)

In order to work, this application requires an STS capable of generating signed JWT tokens.
We use Tribestream API Gateway as it's a complete Security Token Service.
It's also capable of doing routing and while enforcing permissions.
